Andrew Shang: but it hit really hard

Andrew Shang: so thats why i said that

Lexie: what realization

Andrew Shang: but like ofc i know what you think but like sometimes i just say like o it quite hard to have hang out time nowadays as like a statement

Andrew Shang: uh

Andrew Shang: its just a realization thats all like an eureka moment

Andrew Shang: similar to how you might not know something in class and then you figure it out

Andrew Shang: but like sometimes when i have something come up im like who can i do it with im like huh maybe i ask you but its more like when you ask someone something you alr know the answer to but you ask it to be nice or whatever idk i do this maybe not everyone does this and like i dunno maybe out of 10000 times 1 time something might happen so might as well be ask if you have time

Andrew Shang: like yesterday admittedly i do regret calling you but i had something come up and was gonna ask if you wanted it too so yeah

Andrew Shang: but then the second time that was instinctive accident

Andrew Shang: you just happened to be the most recent person i called and muscle memory kinda pressed without looking at name

Andrew Shang: admittedly there were a few other cases where i didnt bother with you so i gave it to other people like going places off campus or diff city or some events being held but tbf im sure you woulda said no anyways

Andrew Shang: aye i have a q do you wanna ft study at like 1am or sometime late

Andrew Shang

Lexie: What

Andrew Shang: but if you do i also kinda want it so that you can read my messages in real time so i dont have to wait

Lexie: What is

Andrew Shang: what

Lexie: What

Lexie: Is it

Andrew Shang: oh uh

Andrew Shang: so this might not matter that much to you but for me it does a tiny bit

Andrew Shang: but like

Lexie: Yes

Andrew Shang: i think i decided to let myself go and start really trying to let you go as someone of like romantic interest not friend btw just to make that clear we can still be friends i think

Lexie: Oh oke

Andrew Shang: but that was kinda something that kinda randomly happened because on monday when you did that hand thing a large part of me felt uncomfortable by it tbh

Andrew Shang: ouch only an oke

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: i mean ikikik nothing would happen between us but i still somewhat had some hope idk why

Lexie: What hand thing

Andrew Shang: when you walked away

Andrew Shang: you held out your hand

Andrew Shang: and like laced it with mine

Lexie: Oh yee

Andrew Shang: sighhh

Lexie: I mean what else you want me to say smh

Andrew Shang: well

Andrew Shang: i think thats a reasonable thing to

Andrew Shang: but like

Andrew Shang: would i still date you yeah because thats just me

Andrew Shang: but like i should still try to slowly get over it somehow

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: and like idk how much i can take being a friend i guess

Andrew Shang: no that i dont like being your friend i do

Lexie: Wh

Andrew Shang: but its like always a lingering thought of waht if or something

Andrew Shang: and then once you do start dating or something and i know about it i dunno i still think it would hurt me

Andrew Shang: would i sitll be happy for you yeah sure

Andrew Shang: but just knowing you found someone better and that wasnt me it just stings

Lexie: Yeah I know what you mean

Andrew Shang: i would like to do myself dirty one more time

Andrew Shang: can i ask

Andrew Shang: we dont have a shot anymore whatsoever right

Lexie

Andrew Shang: yeah i have

Andrew Shang: still would like to hear again

Andrew Shang: i would also like to ask another thing too

Andrew Shang: i would like to ask though are you considering dating anyone rn i would like a complete honest answer if you can please

Andrew Shang: you not answering is killing me

Lexie: Uhhhh

Andrew Shang: pls

Lexie: Prob not:  And not really

Andrew Shang: are you sure about the second one

Lexie: Like am I open to dating

Lexie: Yes

Andrew Shang: i would still really like that water botle and animals back ideally

Lexie

Andrew Shang: but rip those i can never get back

Andrew Shang: i sitll dont get why

Andrew Shang: this is like

Lexie

Andrew Shang: if you broke up with your ex why keep some of their stuff

Lexie

Andrew Shang: well yeah but its like

Andrew Shang: you dont have feelings towards me no more

Lexie: idk just talking but like is kinda weird

Andrew Shang: they arent that significant anymore

Andrew Shang: what

Andrew Shang: whats weird

Andrew Shang: oh well i wasnt implying you were my ex

Andrew Shang: i was just using an example

Lexie: ehhh nvrmd

Andrew Shang: what

Lexie

Lexie: nvrmd

Andrew Shang: tell me

Andrew Shang: pls

Lexie: nawww

Lexie: idt i should

Andrew Shang: this is like when you plot to kill someone but dont tell them how they got to where they got and died by whose hands

Andrew Shang: pls

Andrew Shang: plsplsplss

Andrew Shang: cmon there no shot we get together you alr said and i believe that

Andrew Shang: what is there to like

Lexie

Andrew Shang: not say at this point

Andrew Shang: i feel like this is like prime friendship at this point

Lexie

Andrew Shang: oh yeah yeah that is weird in that aspect and maybe saying ex wasnt that appropriate now in that way

Lexie: and you just kinda stepped on it a bunch of times and told me it would never happen

Andrew Shang: theres a lot of wounds between our relationship thus far

Andrew Shang: and rip at the position im at rn i have no shot at making amends or anything like that

Andrew Shang: well even if there was time is not our friend

Andrew Shang: lets say a long recovery period we graduate by then

Andrew Shang: and most likely diff places because jobs are everywhere in the us and around the world

Andrew Shang: i can never predict the future i must say but i find it hard to believe ill find someone i like more than you

Andrew Shang: kevin asked me a question 2 nights ago

Andrew Shang: asked me who i thought the prettiest hottest cutests whateverest celebrity was

Andrew Shang: i told him i didnt find anyone that amazingly attractive at all

Lexie

Lexie: What about iu I thought you liked her

Andrew Shang: what i didnt tell him was that youre the only person ive ever thought was better than any one celebrity or anyone else ive met thus far in life

Andrew Shang: that was more for meme because of chris

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i thought you knew about this

Andrew Shang: maybe not but i suppose now you do it was all for meme

Lexie: Well I thought you were still kinda into her

Lexie: Or yuqi

Lexie: You liked her too

Andrew Shang: nah yuqi would more be a homie

Lexie: Said she was really pretty

Lexie: And cute

Andrew Shang: i mean who is a celebrity and isnt

Andrew Shang: but does she top any list of mine no

Andrew Shang: kevin just thinks my standards are high

Andrew Shang: but my standards are just you tbh

Andrew Shang: i almost told him that part but then i realized what was going on before i rambled away

Lexie: Oh ic

Andrew Shang: but yeah that was a lot of what i wanted to tell you

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i dont regret a thing between us but also i regret a lot but yeah

Andrew Shang: well

Andrew Shang: i didnt think it was appropriate to say tbh

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: who knows

Andrew Shang: i dont even know

Lexie: Eh is fine

Lexie: Why not

Andrew Shang: hah

Andrew Shang: you words sting but i find it amusing

Andrew Shang: i find what its like on you at tams

Lexie: No

Andrew Shang: well i dont mean it in a messed up way

Lexie

Andrew Shang: it hurts less

Andrew Shang: and it isnt amusing

Andrew Shang: sorry that was in bad taste

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i know you arent

Andrew Shang: i know what i did

Lexie: Remember that one day

Lexie: In gab

Lexie: The stairwell

Andrew Shang: i know that day

Andrew Shang: all too well

Andrew Shang: that was probably one of the worst days

Andrew Shang: in memory

Andrew Shang: thats immediate

Lexie: I was standing there crying

Andrew Shang: i cant even say sorry i think idk if i have the chance to or the ability to from you

Andrew Shang: ok idk if that made sense

Andrew Shang: i can say sorry thats not what i meant

Andrew Shang: i just meant like i can say it

Andrew Shang: but like you have to give me the opportunity to if you get what i mean by that

Andrew Shang: ok idk how to describe it

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i know what im describing but you dont forget i said that

Andrew Shang: oh you do

Andrew Shang: well i didnt mean it in any messed up way or bad way

Andrew Shang: if you didnt understand it that is

Andrew Shang: one of the realizations that hit me

Andrew Shang: it was imagine a diff timeline

Andrew Shang: we start dating right but then like your parents be like

Andrew Shang: oh yeah so tell me about you 2

Andrew Shang: or like

Andrew Shang: you tell you rown parents or somethng

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: that kinda was like one major thing i was like

Andrew Shang: yeahh we arent wokring out ever in the next 100 lifetimes

Andrew Shang: why that was notable or even thought of it

Andrew Shang: was because i was thinking id cry when tiff or jen or marie starts dating

Andrew Shang: and id like to know about the dude and protect them

Lexie: Yea makes sense

Andrew Shang: and yeah as their guardian but not guardian if i heard that

Andrew Shang: maybe not

Lexie: Like a dad or smth

Andrew Shang: so thats one reason for we never getting together

Andrew Shang: yeah

Lexie: Wait wdym

Andrew Shang: what

Andrew Shang: i thought i explained it well

Lexie

Andrew Shang: what do you not get

Lexie

Andrew Shang: oh

Andrew Shang: because like i feel like i have to protect them as if they were mine

Andrew Shang: like my kids or something

Lexie: Yeye

Andrew Shang: and i gotta know the dude they dating is ight

Lexie

Lexie

Lexie: Or you would feel the same

Andrew Shang: wait what

Andrew Shang: no im saying like

Andrew Shang: ok lets say bam we start dating

Andrew Shang: you go to your parents

Andrew Shang: yo im dating

Andrew Shang: and they like ok who this

Andrew Shang: and you like o this is the guy

Lexie: Icic

Andrew Shang: was like a oh yeah aint ever making past the neighborhood entrance

Andrew Shang: but i would like to say

Andrew Shang: while i am going to be more open to dating other people now

Andrew Shang: if you ever accidentally at all give me a chance im taking it and running w it

Andrew Shang: so ideally you dont let that happen

Andrew Shang: or you do

Andrew Shang: but i doubt you do

Andrew Shang: so watch out I suppose

Lexie

Andrew Shang: want what

Lexie

Lexie

Andrew Shang: well

Andrew Shang: i would love to have that happen

Andrew Shang: but i didnt mean it as in like i dont but i do

Andrew Shang: i mean it as like

Andrew Shang: well then i wouldnt have said or you do

Andrew Shang: you know what

Andrew Shang: take it as i do want it to happen

Andrew Shang: it would be quite literally the opportunity of a lifetime

Andrew Shang: on my momma if i get a chance to date you youd have to kill me to find somene else

Andrew Shang: unless its those tik toks that are like would you cheat on your bf for 20k bruh thats 20k cheat on me

Andrew Shang: 20k is like a whole internship salary

Andrew Shang: aint no one worth more than a free 20k

Andrew Shang: just come back bruh

Andrew Shang: split the 20 grand

Andrew Shang: that going towards a car bruh

Andrew Shang: i do not advocate cheating i swear

Andrew Shang: nor would i do it

Andrew Shang: but like if i were offered it

Andrew Shang: im convincing that other person bruh

Lexie: LOLL

Andrew Shang: you got to be stupid to not

Andrew Shang: like if i had to suck a man for a mill

Andrew Shang: bruh give me 100 ill do it

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: not like

Andrew Shang: 100 bucks

Lexie

Lexie: Omy

Andrew Shang: bruh

Lexie: Your gay is showing

Lexie: XDD

Andrew Shang: it wouldnt show if just hypothetically

Andrew Shang: one day we started dating

Andrew Shang: just a shower thought

Andrew Shang: all hypothetical

Andrew Shang: you know what makes me sad that life be too busy nowadays and moving too fast to do stuff w you even just normally

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Lexie: Ehhh :  Eating food is possible

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: i guess

Lexie

Lexie

Lexie: Friendsgiving never done it

Andrew Shang: well it doesnt come out until after break started

Lexie

Andrew Shang: no shot

Andrew Shang: as someone who doesnt text me first

Lexie

Lexie: After 21 sure

Lexie

Andrew Shang: by the time you 21 we graduated bro

Andrew Shang: and you dont turn 21 until after grad

Andrew Shang: so

Andrew Shang: see this is also another reason i had

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: so like a lot of things just naturally dont work out

Andrew Shang: so its like oh maybe that just was meant that way

Andrew Shang: like id imagine youd or even me id prefer to date somene i can be around like you in dallas bro and go to same school but hang out time like 10 times a sem

Andrew Shang: so its like a lot of things dont line up well enough

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: job diff and within these years who knows who you meet

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: thats also why i advocate going out w non family during break for you

Andrew Shang: you have so many people around you in dallas your roots are there

Andrew Shang: so you find someone you think is ight and bam ez date

Andrew Shang: i mean id do the same but idk anyone in austin so during breaks i just literally sit at home do nothing

Andrew Shang: if i were in houston id be working out w the yaos

Andrew Shang: in dallas id chill w ethan and chris

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: literally a simple ok i choose you and ez to build a relationship

Lexie: Not really

Andrew Shang

Lexie: Why would i arbitrarily pick someone

Lexie: I have to actually like them

Andrew Shang: oh yeah ofc i know that yeah

Andrew Shang: it cant just be anyone ofc

Andrew Shang: but like who doesnt start out as friends

Andrew Shang: everyone is a friend until they arent

Andrew Shang: so its literally like ok this is the break i can build a stronger bond with these people

Andrew Shang: and well some feelings get caught and seeing each other is pretty easy so yeah

Lexie: Idk

Andrew Shang: muahaha are feelings still lingering from me

Andrew Shang: kek jk

Andrew Shang: that was a bad joke bad taste

Andrew Shang: im sorry about that

Lexie: Is fine

Andrew Shang: i want to talk to you more

Andrew Shang: except the only good reasonable time is over break

Andrew Shang: except i also dont think i should

Lexie: Talk to me more then smh

Andrew Shang: if it were possible

Andrew Shang: id call you every freaking day

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: i have to add you to my favorites list so you calls can go through when my phones on work focus or sleep focus

Andrew Shang: i hope you know how significant being added to my favorites list is

Andrew Shang: it used to only be family

Andrew Shang: then at tams it was only ethan

Andrew Shang: then here i added kevin and steven because kevin sometimes has important stuff to call me about and steven because i go back to austin

Andrew Shang: you are the first non family girl to be added there

Andrew Shang: and place you first to make you higher

Lexie

Lexie: Wait so where am i

Andrew Shang: heh

Andrew Shang: well

Andrew Shang: because i think the fav list goes from who you added first to last

Andrew Shang: so i added my dad first

Andrew Shang: home second

Andrew Shang: mom 3rd

Andrew Shang: sister 4th

Andrew Shang: ethan was 5th

Andrew Shang: but youre 5th

Andrew Shang: then ethan falls there

Andrew Shang: and then yaos follows last

Lexie: why do you need me to be present in the moment

Andrew Shang: so basically a little backstory ive worn thin lens before idk either im too used to thick lens or idt it looks good on me and im currently wearing thick lens which i like but i also kinda wanna try something new the half lens but idk what you think but i only have half frame links to send you

Andrew Shang: ok you are right about that i just figured it would be better to get you there rn

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: oh and this

Andrew Shang: i saw this the other day literally yesterday from one of your favoriate guys

Andrew Shang: glases looked nice

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: lemme get you a google photos link

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: theres not much in there

Andrew Shang: but maybe you can use that

Andrew Shang: though that was more personal use than anything

Andrew Shang: and currently my glasses are size 55 by 17 or whatever

Andrew Shang: one of the images tehre is a 52 x 21

Andrew Shang: i dont really know how to feel about smaller sized lenses on my face

Andrew Shang: because i feel like it looks too small

Andrew Shang: but i would like your general take or maybe you hate them all and think i should choose a thick frame or a thin frame

Lexie

Lexie: I like this one

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Lexie: uhmmm

Lexie: the ones in the pics look big on your face imo

Andrew Shang: really

Andrew Shang: this is news

Lexie

Lexie: could be the angle

Lexie: but it makes you look cat eyed

Lexie: which is weird

Lexie

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: i think thats what you mean i actually didnt notice that thank you for pointing that out

Andrew Shang: i think youre right i used to have glasses that had the silver ovals on the side and i dont like them idk how i didnt notice originally

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: because in one of the google photos i have a gold variant of the silver you like

Lexie: silver

Lexie

Lexie: silver

Andrew Shang: wait on the site theres also that gold variant lol

Lexie: yea I saw it

Lexie: silver is nicer

Lexie: wait not a diff style

Lexie

Lexie: similar style

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: okokok yeah i want one thats 55 x something like my current ones

Andrew Shang: but i think why my current ones also look big is cuz frame is thicker

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: literally because that one is size 52 and the other is 51 lol

Lexie: ye that one is good too

Lexie: if it fits better go fro that one

Andrew Shang: oh shiiiii wwwwww

Andrew Shang: what are your thoughts on white glasses or clear ones
