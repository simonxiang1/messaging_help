Andrew Shang: one of the images tehre is a 52 x 21

Andrew Shang: and currently my glasses are size 55 by 17 or whatever

Andrew Shang: though that was more personal use than anything

Andrew Shang: but maybe you can use that

Lexie: Is fine

Andrew Shang: im sorry about that

Andrew Shang: that was a bad joke bad taste

Andrew Shang: kek jk

Andrew Shang: muahaha are feelings still lingering from me

Lexie: Idk

Andrew Shang: and well some feelings get caught and seeing each other is pretty easy so yeah

Andrew Shang: so its literally like ok this is the break i can build a stronger bond with these people

Andrew Shang: everyone is a friend until they arent

Andrew Shang: but like who doesnt start out as friends

Andrew Shang: it cant just be anyone ofc

Andrew Shang: oh yeah ofc i know that yeah

Lexie: I have to actually like them

Lexie: Why would i arbitrarily pick someone

Andrew Shang

Lexie: Not really

Andrew Shang: literally a simple ok i choose you and ez to build a relationship

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: in dallas id chill w ethan and chris

Andrew Shang: if i were in houston id be working out w the yaos

Andrew Shang: i mean id do the same but idk anyone in austin so during breaks i just literally sit at home do nothing

Andrew Shang: so you find someone you think is ight and bam ez date

Andrew Shang: you have so many people around you in dallas your roots are there

Andrew Shang: thats also why i advocate going out w non family during break for you

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: job diff and within these years who knows who you meet

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: so its like a lot of things dont line up well enough

Andrew Shang: like id imagine youd or even me id prefer to date somene i can be around like you in dallas bro and go to same school but hang out time like 10 times a sem

Andrew Shang: so its like oh maybe that just was meant that way

Andrew Shang: so like a lot of things just naturally dont work out

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: see this is also another reason i had

Andrew Shang: so

Andrew Shang: and you dont turn 21 until after grad

Andrew Shang: by the time you 21 we graduated bro

Lexie

Lexie: After 21 sure

Lexie

Andrew Shang: as someone who doesnt text me first

Andrew Shang: no shot

Lexie

Andrew Shang: well it doesnt come out until after break started

Lexie: Friendsgiving never done it

Lexie

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i guess

Andrew Shang

Lexie: Ehhh :  Eating food is possible

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: you know what makes me sad that life be too busy nowadays and moving too fast to do stuff w you even just normally

Andrew Shang: all hypothetical

Andrew Shang: just a shower thought

Andrew Shang: one day we started dating

Andrew Shang: it wouldnt show if just hypothetically

Lexie: XDD

Lexie: Your gay is showing

Andrew Shang: bruh

Lexie: Omy

Lexie

Andrew Shang: 100 bucks

Andrew Shang: not like

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: bruh give me 100 ill do it

Andrew Shang: like if i had to suck a man for a mill

Andrew Shang: but like if i were offered it

Andrew Shang: nor would i do it

Andrew Shang: i do not advocate cheating i swear

Andrew Shang: that going towards a car bruh

Andrew Shang: split the 20 grand

Andrew Shang: just come back bruh

Andrew Shang: aint no one worth more than a free 20k

Andrew Shang: 20k is like a whole internship salary

Andrew Shang: unless its those tik toks that are like would you cheat on your bf for 20k bruh thats 20k cheat on me

Andrew Shang: on my momma if i get a chance to date you youd have to kill me to find somene else

Andrew Shang: it would be quite literally the opportunity of a lifetime

Andrew Shang: take it as i do want it to happen

Andrew Shang: you know what

Andrew Shang: well then i wouldnt have said or you do

Andrew Shang: i mean it as like

Andrew Shang: but i didnt mean it as in like i dont but i do

Andrew Shang: i would love to have that happen

Andrew Shang: well

Lexie

Lexie

Andrew Shang: want what

Lexie

Andrew Shang: so watch out I suppose

Andrew Shang: but i doubt you do

Andrew Shang: or you do

Andrew Shang: so ideally you dont let that happen

Andrew Shang: if you ever accidentally at all give me a chance im taking it and running w it

Andrew Shang: while i am going to be more open to dating other people now

Andrew Shang: but i would like to say

Andrew Shang: was like a oh yeah aint ever making past the neighborhood entrance

Lexie: Icic

Andrew Shang: that reasoning right there

Andrew Shang: yeah

Lexie: I get now

Lexie

Andrew Shang: yeah

Lexie: I get I get

Lexie: I get

Lexie: Icicicic

Andrew Shang: o and he hurt me before but we dating rn

Andrew Shang: and they like ok who this

Andrew Shang: yo im dating

Andrew Shang: you go to your parents

Andrew Shang: because like i feel like i have to protect them as if they were mine

Andrew Shang: oh

Lexie

Andrew Shang: what do you not get

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i thought i explained it well

Andrew Shang: what

Lexie: Wait wdym

Andrew Shang: yeah

Andrew Shang: so thats one reason for we never getting together

Lexie: Like a dad or smth

Andrew Shang: maybe not

Andrew Shang: and yeah as their guardian but not guardian if i heard that

Lexie: Yea makes sense

Andrew Shang: and id like to know about the dude and protect them

Andrew Shang: was because i was thinking id cry when tiff or jen or marie starts dating

Andrew Shang: why that was notable or even thought of it

Andrew Shang: yeahh we arent wokring out ever in the next 100 lifetimes

Andrew Shang: that kinda was like one major thing i was like

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: you tell you rown parents or somethng

Andrew Shang: or like

Andrew Shang: oh yeah so tell me about you 2

Andrew Shang: we start dating right but then like your parents be like

Andrew Shang: it was imagine a diff timeline

Andrew Shang: one of the realizations that hit me

Andrew Shang: if you didnt understand it that is

Andrew Shang: well i didnt mean it in any messed up way or bad way

Andrew Shang: oh you do

Andrew Shang: i know what im describing but you dont forget i said that

Lexie

Andrew Shang: ok idk how to describe it

Andrew Shang: but like you have to give me the opportunity to if you get what i mean by that

Andrew Shang: i just meant like i can say it

Andrew Shang: i can say sorry thats not what i meant

Andrew Shang: ok idk if that made sense

Andrew Shang: i cant even say sorry i think idk if i have the chance to or the ability to from you

Lexie: I was standing there crying

Andrew Shang: thats immediate

Andrew Shang: in memory

Andrew Shang: that was probably one of the worst days

Andrew Shang: all too well

Andrew Shang: i know that day

Lexie: The stairwell

Lexie: In gab

Lexie: Remember that one day

Andrew Shang: i know what i did

Andrew Shang: i know you arent

Lexie

Andrew Shang: sorry that was in bad taste

Andrew Shang: and it isnt amusing

Andrew Shang: it hurts less

Lexie

Andrew Shang: well i dont mean it in a messed up way

Lexie: No

Andrew Shang: i find what its like on you at tams

Andrew Shang: you words sting but i find it amusing

Andrew Shang: hah

Lexie: Why not

Lexie: Eh is fine

Andrew Shang: i dont even know

Andrew Shang: who knows

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: i didnt think it was appropriate to say tbh

Andrew Shang: well

Andrew Shang: i dont regret a thing between us but also i regret a lot but yeah

Lexie

Andrew Shang: but yeah that was a lot of what i wanted to tell you

Lexie: Oh ic

Andrew Shang: i almost told him that part but then i realized what was going on before i rambled away

Andrew Shang: but my standards are just you tbh

Andrew Shang: kevin just thinks my standards are high

Andrew Shang: but does she top any list of mine no

Andrew Shang: i mean who is a celebrity and isnt

Lexie: And cute

Lexie: Said she was really pretty

Andrew Shang: nah yuqi would more be a homie

Lexie: You liked her too

Lexie: Or yuqi

Lexie: Well I thought you were still kinda into her

Andrew Shang: maybe not but i suppose now you do it was all for meme

Andrew Shang: i thought you knew about this

Lexie

Andrew Shang: that was more for meme because of chris

Andrew Shang: what i didnt tell him was that youre the only person ive ever thought was better than any one celebrity or anyone else ive met thus far in life

Lexie: What about iu I thought you liked her

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i told him i didnt find anyone that amazingly attractive at all

Andrew Shang: asked me who i thought the prettiest hottest cutests whateverest celebrity was

Andrew Shang: kevin asked me a question 2 nights ago

Andrew Shang: i can never predict the future i must say but i find it hard to believe ill find someone i like more than you

Andrew Shang: and most likely diff places because jobs are everywhere in the us and around the world

Andrew Shang: lets say a long recovery period we graduate by then

Andrew Shang: well even if there was time is not our friend

Andrew Shang: and rip at the position im at rn i have no shot at making amends or anything like that

Andrew Shang: theres a lot of wounds between our relationship thus far

Lexie: and you just kinda stepped on it a bunch of times and told me it would never happen

Andrew Shang: oh yeah yeah that is weird in that aspect and maybe saying ex wasnt that appropriate now in that way

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i feel like this is like prime friendship at this point

Andrew Shang: not say at this point

Lexie

Andrew Shang: what is there to like

Andrew Shang: cmon there no shot we get together you alr said and i believe that

Andrew Shang: plsplsplss

Andrew Shang: pls

Andrew Shang: this is like when you plot to kill someone but dont tell them how they got to where they got and died by whose hands

Lexie: idt i should

Lexie: nawww

Andrew Shang: pls

Andrew Shang: tell me

Lexie: nvrmd

Lexie

Andrew Shang: what

Lexie: ehhh nvrmd

Andrew Shang: i was just using an example

Andrew Shang: oh well i wasnt implying you were my ex

Andrew Shang: whats weird

Andrew Shang: what

Andrew Shang: they arent that significant anymore

Lexie: idk just talking but like is kinda weird

Andrew Shang: you dont have feelings towards me no more

Andrew Shang: well yeah but its like

Lexie

Andrew Shang: if you broke up with your ex why keep some of their stuff

Lexie

Andrew Shang: this is like

Andrew Shang: i sitll dont get why

Andrew Shang: but rip those i can never get back

Lexie

Andrew Shang: i would still really like that water botle and animals back ideally

Andrew Shang: i think it was good knowing you even if i did mess a lot of stuff up

Andrew Shang: well

Lexie: LOL

Andrew Shang: nah nothing i was trying to make a joke but it was bad

Lexie: Smh

Andrew Shang: i would also like to ask another thing too

Andrew Shang: still would like to hear again

Andrew Shang: yeah i have

Lexie

Andrew Shang: we dont have a shot anymore whatsoever right

Andrew Shang: can i ask

Andrew Shang: i would like to do myself dirty one more time

Lexie: Yeah I know what you mean

Andrew Shang: but just knowing you found someone better and that wasnt me it just stings

Andrew Shang: would i sitll be happy for you yeah sure

Andrew Shang: and then once you do start dating or something and i know about it i dunno i still think it would hurt me

Andrew Shang: but its like always a lingering thought of waht if or something

Lexie: Wh

Andrew Shang: no that i dont like being your friend i do

Andrew Shang: and like idk how much i can take being a friend i guess

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: but like i should still try to slowly get over it somehow

Andrew Shang: would i still date you yeah because thats just me

Andrew Shang: but like

Andrew Shang: i think thats a reasonable thing to

Andrew Shang: well

Lexie: I mean what else you want me to say smh

Andrew Shang: sighhh

Lexie: Oh yee

Andrew Shang: and like laced it with mine

Andrew Shang: you held out your hand

Andrew Shang: when you walked away

Lexie: What hand thing

Andrew Shang: i mean ikikik nothing would happen between us but i still somewhat had some hope idk why

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: ouch only an oke

Andrew Shang: but that was kinda something that kinda randomly happened because on monday when you did that hand thing a large part of me felt uncomfortable by it tbh

Lexie: Oh oke

Andrew Shang: i think i decided to let myself go and start really trying to let you go as someone of like romantic interest not friend btw just to make that clear we can still be friends i think

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang

Andrew Shang: aye i have a q do you wanna ft study at like 1am or sometime late

Andrew Shang: admittedly there were a few other cases where i didnt bother with you so i gave it to other people like going places off campus or diff city or some events being held but tbf im sure you woulda said no anyways

Andrew Shang: you just happened to be the most recent person i called and muscle memory kinda pressed without looking at name

Andrew Shang: but then the second time that was instinctive accident

Andrew Shang: like yesterday admittedly i do regret calling you but i had something come up and was gonna ask if you wanted it too so yeah

Andrew Shang: but like sometimes when i have something come up im like who can i do it with im like huh maybe i ask you but its more like when you ask someone something you alr know the answer to but you ask it to be nice or whatever idk i do this maybe not everyone does this and like i dunno maybe out of 10000 times 1 time something might happen so might as well be ask if you have time

Andrew Shang: similar to how you might not know something in class and then you figure it out

Andrew Shang: its just a realization thats all like an eureka moment

Andrew Shang: uh

Andrew Shang: but like ofc i know what you think but like sometimes i just say like o it quite hard to have hang out time nowadays as like a statement

Lexie: what realization

Andrew Shang: so thats why i said that

Andrew Shang: but it hit really hard

Andrew Shang: i dont actually want to say what made me think of that

Andrew Shang: AND THATS WHY THAT ONE NIGHT OR THAT NEXT DAY I WAS LIKE IF YOU BUSY I DONT MIND WHATSOEVER

Andrew Shang: ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS WITH ANTHNY I HAD THIS REALIZATION

Lexie

Andrew Shang: WAIT WAIT WIAT

Lexie

Lexie

Andrew Shang: WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT NO I DIDNT MEAN IT LIKE THAT
